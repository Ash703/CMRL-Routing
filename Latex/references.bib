abstract = {Equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) is a routing technique for routing   packets along multiple paths of equal cost.  The forwarding engine   identifies paths by next-hop.  When forwarding a packet the router   must decide which next-hop (path) to use.  This document gives an   analysis of one method for making that decision.  The analysis   includes the performance of the algorithm and the disruption caused   by changes to the set of next-hops.}

abstract = {Today's data centers offer tremendous aggregate bandwidth to clusters of tens of thousands of machines. However, because of limited port densities in even the highest-end switches, data center topologies typically consist of multi-rooted trees with many equal-cost paths between any given pair of hosts. Existing IP multipathing protocols usually rely on per-flow static hashing and can cause substantial bandwidth losses due to long-term collisions.In this paper, we present Hedera, a scalable, dynamic flow scheduling system that adaptively schedules a multi-stage switching fabric to efficiently utilize aggregate network resources. We describe our implementation using commodity switches and unmodified hosts, and show that for a simulated 8,192 host data center, Hedera delivers bisection bandwidth that is 96\% of optimal and up to 113\% better than static load-balancing methods.},
